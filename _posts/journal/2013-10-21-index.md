After [yesterday](/journal/2013/10/19) mentioning that I hadn't done much work
on the site since I launched it I felt the need to rectify that situation. I
chucked season 3 of The Walking Dead into the DVD player sat down on the couch
with my laptop and started to work away on the site, I was happy with what I
accomplished in an afternoon. The biggest accomplishment would have to be the
site now has a variety of atom feeds, one for articles only, another for only
journal entries and finally a feed that combines the two. The full list of
changes are:

* Fixed a bug where the slug for an article wasn't being created correctly which led to malformed URLs.
* Updated the styling of inline code to appear more like multi-line code blocks, though looking at the site now the update wasn't perfect as code in lists are still broken.
* Added atom feeds for articles, journal entries and a feed that combines the two.

There was a pretty major issue that occurred while deploying the site where none
of the assets were loading so the site had no styling or images. I made the quick
fix of copying the contents of the `app/assets` directory into the `public`
directory, I need to investigate further about why that didn't work as expected
and get a permanent fix in place.
