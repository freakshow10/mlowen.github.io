Took a bit of a break from the side project that I've been working on recently to [revisit a concept](http://mike.lowen.co.nz/journal/2015/03/01/) I had previously been playing around with - a single page application extension for [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/). The previous attempt was called Knockout.Router  unfortunately between the last time I worked on it and now someone has already setup their extension with the [same name on bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=knockout-router) something that I was hoping to do with this extension. With that in mind I decided to change the name to [Knockout-SinglePage](https://github.com/mlowen/knockout-singlepage) and rewrite it in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). This time I am hoping to implement it the "proper" way writing a test suite and [setting up continuous integration](https://travis-ci.org/mlowen/knockout-singlepage) I haven't made the progress that I was hoping for this weekend, however I think the quality of the work is definitely higher than what it was in my last attempt.

Recently I have also been playing around with the concept of using [knockout components](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html) and events in [wizards](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(software)>) to produce decoupled re-usable panes. This was something that I did at work over a year ago (not using components or events) and I was never completely satisfied with the solution that I came up with, so after it bugging me for a while I decided to take another crack at it. Once I have something up and running nicely I will probably put an article together about it.
