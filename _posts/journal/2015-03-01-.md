Didn't do much work on any of my projects this weekend though I did get some time
stuck into [Shadowrun Returns](http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun/) which
I'm greatly enjoying. What little project work I did do this weekend was spent
on getting a consistent and reproducible [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) development environment setup using
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Chef Solo](https://docs.chef.io/chef_solo.html),
and [Docker](https://docker.com/). Once I've got a chance I'm going to try and
write up my experiences in getting this all working.

I'm really intrigued by the concept of Docker and Vagrant where we can achieve a
development environment which is very close to production in terms of dependencies
and system setup, while being operating system agnostic. I have to give a big
shout out to [Ryan](https://twitter.com/RyanFrenchNZ) who's been using these
technologies as well and over the last couple of weeks while I planned things
out and got them set up has fielded all of my questions and given me guidance
when I've gotten stuck.

Unfortunately I've made little progress with
[Knockout.Router](https://github.com/mlowen/Knockout.Router) I've been attempting
to use regular expressions to get the parsing of the route URLs for dynamic
routing working as I'd like them to, but so far I've had little success.

Yesterday I got the chance to read an [article about #NoEstimates](https://medium.com/backchannel/estimates-we-don-t-need-no-stinking-estimates-dcbddccbd3d4)
which I found quite interesting. As someone who both has to do estimates and is
a fan of [agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) I
think that (in my workplace at least) we waste a lot of time on up front work
needed to estimate projects (before handing them over to an agile software
development team) which could be better spent giving the development team some
time to get stuck into the project, I wouldn't mind betting if that was the case
we'd probably be able to give the business greater certainty over how long we
think it might take than what we do currently.

Over the coming week I have a couple of things I would like to try and achieve:

* I want to get my site migrated over to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  as the only thing I am using this server from [Host4Geeks](https://host4geeks.com/)
  for is hosting this site which feels like a bit of a waste.
* I would like to get another blog post written. At the moment I'm tossing up
  between redoing a post I lost when I built this site or about my experiences
  with setting up my dev environment.
* I want to try and get dynamic routing working for Knockout.Router.

Hopefully by putting them up on the web I will actually bring myself to do them.
