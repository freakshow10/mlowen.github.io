Finished the first article for the site - four days after posting the first journal
entry. Found a nasty bug when trying to view the article by itself where '.' characters
are not being replaced in the slug for the article and that is causing an error
when trying to visit the article directly. For now I've done a quick fix in the
database but I'll need to add in something more permanent soon, I've also noticed
some issues around time zones which I'll need to look. Those two things aside I'm
happy to finally have the new site live and populated with some content.

Now that the site is live I feel that I can work on something different, I'm thinking
at this point I might start work on an idea I have around a documentation project
inspired by [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). That can wait for tomorrow though,
tonight the better half and myself are going to pay a visit to [Good George](http://www.goodgeorge.co.nz/)
for a nice relaxing drink.
