It's been a busy past few weeks, so I'll try to just give the highlights of what's
been going on. On the 29th of September went with group of friends to the first
[Digital Nationz](http://digitalnationz.com/). I wasn't 100% sure what I was
expecting but It wasn't what I thought it would be, that isn't a bad thing considering
I was unsure to begin with. I think it was a good first year and in a couple of
years it's going to be something really special.

One of the exhibits I particularly enjoyed was the computer/games museum it was
awesome to see how technology has evolved over the years and a bit of trip down
memory lane. The people behind the museum exhibit is trying to crowd fund building
a [permanent computing museum in New Zealand](http://www.sponsume.com/project/new-zealand-computer-museum)
which is an effort I think is well worth supporting.

As I mentioned in the [first article](http://mlowen.com/article/2013/09/20/welcome-to-the-new-mlowen-com)
on the site I have a some other projects which use [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
pretty heavily in the last few weeks I've been working on one of these projects
Codify - a documentation system written in [Python](http://python.org/) which uses
markdown for the source documents. Codify was born out of my frustrations with
[Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) and [reStructuredText](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText),
those frustrations admittedly may have been caused by my ignorance of knowing
how to use the tools correctly. Codify is designed to be more convention over
configuration compared to Sphinx and allows for real time previewing of the
documentation that is being written. However codify doesn't have the nice API
documentation generation functionality that Sphinx supports. Codify is an open
source project available under the [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
which you can find at [GitHub](https://github.com/mlowen/Codify).

During the course of working on Codify, I also made some improvements to
[Glint](https://github.com/mlowen/Glint) and released version 0.2.0 which is
available at the [python package index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Glint/0.2.0),
the changes for 0.2.0 are pretty light:

* Updated the argument parsing to allow optional arguments in the format of `<prefix><name>=<value>`.
* Updated the argument parsing to replace - characters with _ when parsing positional arguments and flags.

I haven't done much work on the site, I started to work on implementing a feed
based on [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4827232/generating-rss-feed-in-rails-3/4832591#4832591)
from stackoverflow, having some trouble getting it working correctly for this
site so it hasn't been completed as of yet.
