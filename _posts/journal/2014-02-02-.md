Spent most of today setting up a new [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) VM on [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) after my attempts at running up Ubuntu under hyper-v meet with [an issue](https://twitter.com/mike_lowen/status/429366401539653634) that I couldn't work around. Also spent some time setting up an environment for easy loading of any utility scripts that I end up writing which I got over in [this blog post](http://mlowen.com/article/2014/02/02/back-to-linux).

Also started thinking about updating the UI for mlowen.com to use [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) so that it has nicer mobile support, something that I probably should have done from the get go.
