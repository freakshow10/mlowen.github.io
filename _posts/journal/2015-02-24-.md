It's been a productive weekend, got stuck into the gardens Saturday morning for some much overdue weeding. Once that was out of the way I had a good run at working on some personal projects. On the programming front I finally got around to fixing [an issue](https://github.com/mlowen/CommonMark.Editor/issues/4) with [CommonMark.Editor](https://github.com/mlowen/CommonMark.Editor) which caused it to break when using a later versions of [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/), if you grab the [latest version](https://github.com/mlowen/CommonMark.Editor/releases/tag/0.3.1) it will work as expected.

Late last week version 3.3.0 of [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) was released, looking through the [post on Knock Me Out](http://www.knockmeout.net/2015/02/knockout-3-3-released.html) I was reminded that Knockout added [components](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html) in version 3.2.0, I mentioned to my friend [Ryan](https://twitter.com/RyanFrenchNZ) that knockout components would allow you to do [single-page applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) with knockout a lot easier as they would do most of the heavy lifting for you, today (Sunday) I decided to play around with the idea you can find my [progress so far at GitHub](https://github.com/mlowen/Knockout.Router). With this little project I'm looking to build more of a light weight extension to Knockout rather than a full framework on top of knockout. Currently it only handles static routes but once it works with dynamic routes I'll do a 0.1.0 release and write up a proper blog post about it.
