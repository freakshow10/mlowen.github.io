Last year I debut [a new mlowen.com](http://mike.lowen.co.nz/article/2013/09/20/welcome-to-the-new-mlowen-com)
which as per the linked article I built on top or [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
mostly as a learning experience. While I was happy with the result looking back
on it now there are a few things I would've like to have done differently, one
of the big ones that I released today was a new look and feel to the site heavily
inspired by the theme that [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/) uses on his site
and uses [twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which allows the site to
respond nicer on smaller devices such as phones, while not perfect I am happier
with it than what was previously there. Also in today's update you can now access
this site from [mike.lowen.co.nz](http://mike.lowen.co.nz), in fact that is now
the [canonical URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element) for this
site.
