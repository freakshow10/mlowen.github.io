Finally finished getting the server setup this evening after work, got a bit hairy
at one point when I almost locked my account out of the server here's a tip folks
remember the `-a` flag on `usermod` when changing a users groups. Now that's all
sorted found my first major issue with the new site - when there are no articles
to display then the front page bails pretty hard. Next step is to get that initial
article written up so that the site can become live or at least less broken.
