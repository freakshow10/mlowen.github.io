Spent this evening playing around with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) getting a
replica of this site running with it, which was nice as it's allowed me to make
a few tweaks to look and feel of the site that I've been meaning to do for a
while. Continuing my experimentation with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for
a personal project, at the point where I'm attempting container linking so I can
have my local database running in a container as well. I've been trying to get
the [paintedfox postgresql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/paintedfox/postgresql/)
container working with an external data volume for the `/data` directory, so far
that hasn't been successful I think it is due to permissions on the data volume
and the fact that docker is running in a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
provisioned VM.
